# plotly_bellybuttons

## Project Overview

Here, I used javascript and html to produce a web dashboard displaying data on microbial diversity in the belly buttons of 
153 anonymous individuals. 
The page allows users to view data for each individual, including the top 10 operational taxon units (OTUs) identified in 
that person's navel, the frequency with which they clean their navel, and counts of all identified OTUs.

For easy viewing, [the webpage can be opened in Github Pages](https://bbjohnson6810.github.io/plotly_bellybuttons/).
